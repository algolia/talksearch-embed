# TalkSearch embed

This here is the code that you'll use to show a TalkSearch implementation on
your site.

## Setting up

This is a `preact-cli` project. You need to run `yarn` to install the
dependencies and `yarn start` for starting. Don't forget to set `NODE_ENV` to
`production` on production.

## Setting an index

The `indexName` is the search string: `http://localhost:8000?i=dotconferences`
